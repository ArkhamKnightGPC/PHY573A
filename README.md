# PHY573A: Micro and Nano electronics Experimental Design

The objective of this experimental module is to implement the design of transistor based on carbon nanotubes.
In more detail, the synthesis of carbon nanotubes by CVD(chemical vapor deposition) approach, the characterization of the latter (SEM and TEM microscopy) and finally the design and characterization of transistors based on these nanotubes will be discussed here.
The deposition of metallic catalysts and CVD was performed in Ecole polytechnique's laboratories with the supervision of [Professor Costel Cojocaru](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Costel-Cojocaru/8). The photolitography procedure was performed in a clean room at [THALES](https://www.thalesgroup.com/fr).
